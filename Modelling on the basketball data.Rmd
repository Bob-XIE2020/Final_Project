## 1. Introduction

### a) Relevant background information of basketball 

Basketball is the third most popular sport in the world, with 2.2 billion fans worldwide.[1] There are two popular types of basketball games, 3x3 and 5x5. Unlike 5x5, which is played on a full-scale basketball court, 3x3 is played on a half-court.[2] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional Basketball league consisting of 30 professional teams in North America. It is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States. [3]

#### Position requirements

According to the NBA's rulebook, each team consists of five players, and each player will be assigned a specific position, namely, center, power forward, small forward, point guard and shooting guard.[4] Shane (2018) suggests that the center is the heart of formation, with the point guard ranked second.[5] The center is the tallest player in a team, being responsible for rim protection, while the point guard is the shortest player in a team, playing a vital role in running the offence, and that is the reason why the point guard is sometimes called the "floor general" by the masses.

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Basketball_Positions.png")
```

#### Key metrics

Basketball statistics have been kept to evaluate players' and teams' performance. Some typical examples of basketball statistics include `points (PTS)`, `efficiency (EFF)`, `steals (STL)`, `rebounds (REB)` and `field goal attempt (FGA)`. Haefner (2022) highlights the four most important stats that should be paid attention to are `field Goal attempts (FGA)`, `effective field goal percentage (EFG%)`, `free throw attempts (FTA)` and `free throw percentage (FT%)`. All these four ratios indicate the chance of winning; the higher the ratios, the higher the possibility of winning the game.[6] Sampaio et al.(2006) use discriminant analysis to identify factors driving a team's long-term success.[7] The result shows that `successful free throws (FT)`, `rebounds (REB)`, `assists (AST)`, `steals (STL)` and `blocks (BLK)` are key differences between the best and worst teams. Fayad (2020) scrapes data from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and builds a model using the random forest algorithm. He suggests that the team's `net rating (NRtg)` and `home-court advantage` also greatly influence wins.[8]

### b) Description of the scenario

Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team headquartered in Chicago. In the most recent season (2018-19), the team was ranked 27th for overall performance and 26th for payroll budget out of thirty teams. In the new season (2019-20), Chicago Bulls will be assigned $118 million for players' contracts.

### c) The aim of the project

The project aims to help Chicago Bulls make the best use of the payroll budget and find the best starting player for each position.

### d) Justification and importance

Players are decisive to a team's long-term success, so it is crucial for managers to find suitable players for their teams. A team that owns players with higher ratings are more likely to win the game. However, some players are unaffordable due to the limited payroll budget, so managers need to balance the team's strength and funding, ensuring every buck is well spent.

## 2. Reading and cleaning the raw data

#### Description of datasets and variables

Five datasets have been used for data analysis, which are  `“2018-19_nba_player-salaries”`, `“2018-19_nba_player-statistics”`, `“2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1”`, `“2018-19_nba_team-statistics_2”` and `“2018-19_nba_team-payroll”`.

#### Load required packages

Two packages will be used in the data wrangling process.

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Packages required
pkgs <- c("tidyverse","naniar")

# Load the packages using a loop
for (i in 1:length(pkgs)){
  if(!(pkgs[i] %in% rownames(installed.packages()))){
    install.packages(pkgs[i])}
  library(pkgs[i],character.only=TRUE)
  }
```

#### Reading the data

Read the files using the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package.

```{r reading_data, message=FALSE}
# CSV files in the "data" folder
files <- list.files("data", pattern = "csv$") 

# Names of the datasets
file_name <- gsub(pattern = ".csv", "",files)

# Empty list
emty_list <- list()

# Read the data using a loop
for (i in 1:length(files)){
  emty_list[[i]] <- read_csv(paste0("data/",files[i]))
  assign(file_name[i],emty_list[[i]]) 
}

# Keep only five datasets
rm(list=setdiff(ls(),file_name))
```

#### Cleaning the data

Display the internal structure of datasets using the `str()` function from `Base-R` and check the existence of missing values with the `any_na()` function from the `naniar` package.

**1. dataset "2018-19_nba_player-salaries" **
```{r dataset_1, message=FALSE}
# Structure
str(`2018-19_nba_player-salaries`)

# Missing values (no missing values have been found)
any_na(`2018-19_nba_player-salaries`)
```

**2. dataset "2018-19_nba_player-statistics"**
```{r dataset_2, message=FALSE}
# Structure
str(`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`)

# Missing values (missing values have been found, and further action is required)
any_na(`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`)
```

**3. dataset "2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1"**
```{r dataset_3, message=FALSE}
# Structure
str(`2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1`)

# Missing values (missing values have been found, and further action is required)
any_na(`2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1`)
```

**4. dataset "2018-19_nba_team-statistics_2"**
```{r dataset_4, message=FALSE}
# Structure
str(`2018-19_nba_team-statistics_2`)

# Missing values (no missing values have been found)
any_na(`2018-19_nba_team-statistics_2`)
```

**5. dataset "2019-20_nba_team-payroll"**
```{r dataset_5, message=FALSE}
# Structure
str(`2019-20_nba_team-payroll`)

# Convert the class of the variable "salary" from character to number
`2019-20_nba_team-payroll`$salary <- parse_number(`2019-20_nba_team-payroll`[['salary']])

# Missing values (no missing values have been found)
any_na(`2019-20_nba_team-payroll`)
```

## 3. Exploratory analysis

### a) Checking for errors and missing values within the datasets

Two datasets were found to have missing values.

- **`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`**
```{r 2018-19_nba_player-statistics, warning=FALSE}
gg_miss_var(`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`,show_pct = TRUE)
```

Missing values in the dataset are the results of dividing zero y zero. For example, `FG% on 3-Pt FGAs (3P%)` is the quotient of `3-Point Field Goals (3P)` and `3-Point Field Goal Attempts (3PA)`. When a player has zero attempts, the ratio will become undefined. Hence, missing values will be replaced with zero.

```{r 2018-19_nba_player-statistics_remove NAs, warning=FALSE}
# Replace missing values
for (i in 1:ncol(`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`)){
  `2018-19_nba_player-statistics`[,i][is.na(`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`[,i])] <- 0
}
```

- **`2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1`**
```{r 2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1, warning=FALSE}
gg_miss_var(`2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1`,show_pct = TRUE)
```

Three empty columns will be removed.
```{r 2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1_remove empty columns}
empty_columns <- sapply(`2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1`, function(x) all(is.na(x) | x == ""))
`2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1` <- `2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1`[, !empty_columns]
```

### b) Checking for the distribution of variables

1. Age

Muhr (2020) analyses NBA player development and has found that players in the 24–28 range have slightly higher expected performance than players in other age groups. 
``` {r age}
# Distribution of players' age
ggplot(`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`,aes(x=Age))+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(y = ..density..), colour = "black", fill = "grey",bins=7)+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3, fill = "dodgerblue")+
  ggtitle("Distribution of players' age")+
  xlab("Players' age")+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```
Most NBA players are in their twenties. It is estimated that players' age directly impacts how many points they can get per game.

2. Salary

``` {r salary}
# Distribution of NBA player salaries
ggplot(`2018-19_nba_player-salaries`,aes(x=salary/1000))+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(y = ..density..), colour = "black", fill = "grey",bins=8)+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3, fill = "dodgerblue")+
  ggtitle("Distribution of NBA player salaries")+
  xlab("Salaries (in thousands)")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma,
                     breaks = seq(0,50000,by=5000))+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```
Most NBA players' salaries are less than 5,000 thousand dollars. The distribution of NBA player salaries is unimodal and right-skewed, with several large outliers.

### c) Checking for relationships between variables, or differences between groups

Use joining functions from the "dplyr" package to create a new data frame `team_stat`. 
``` {r team_stat}
team_stat <- `2018-19_nba_team-statistics_1` %>% left_join(select(`2018-19_nba_team-statistics_2`,-Rk), by = 'Team')
```

Then, create two new variables representing points per game and the percentage of wins, respectively.

``` {r new_variables}
team_stat <- team_stat %>% mutate(PTSG = PTS/G,
                                  WinP = W/G)
```

1. Relationships between variables (teams)

The correlation heatmap using teams' statistics suggests that all variables except `Defensive Rating (DRtg)` and `Turnover Percentage (TOV%)` positively influence `the percentage of wins (WinP)`. There is a correlation of over 98% between `Net Rating (NRtg)` and `the percentage of wins (WinP)`, verifying Fayad's statements.

Some variables, for example, `Net Rating (NRtg)` and `Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%)`, are highly correlated. To avoid the issue of multicollinearity, we can select only one of them in the data modelling process.
``` {r heatmap_teams, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install the package "ellipse" if not installed
if(!require(ellipse)){
  install.packages("ellipse")
}

# Load the package "ellipse"
library(ellipse)

# Create a correlation heatmap using teams' statistics
corr <- team_stat[,c("Age","ORtg","DRtg","NRtg","eFG%","TOV%","ORB%","FT/FGA","DRB%","3P%","FT%","AST","STL","BLK","PTSG","WinP")] %>% cor() 

colorfun <- colorRamp(c("#CC0000","white","#3366CC"), space="Lab")

plotcorr(corr, col=rgb(colorfun((corr+1)/2), maxColorValue=255),
         mar = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))
```

2. Relationships between variables (players)

The correlation heatmap using players' statistics suggests that the variable `Turnovers (TOV)` has the highest impact on the variable `Points per game (PTSG)`. In addition, `Players' age (Age)` and `Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%)` are not the determinant factors of points received at each game.
``` {r heatmap_players, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install the package "corrplot" if not installed
if(!require(corrplot)){
  install.packages("corrplot")
}

# Load the package "corrplot"
library(corrplot)

# Create new variables representing players' performance per game
`2018-19_nba_player-statistics` <- within(`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`,{
  ORBG <- ORB/G
  DRBG <- DRB/G
  TRBG <- TRB/G
  ASTG <- AST/G
  STLG <- STL/G
  BLKG <- BLK/G
  TOVG <- TOV/G
  PFG <- PF/G
  PTSG <- PTS/G
  })

# Potential variables used for data modelling
varibls <- c("Age","FG%","3P%","2P%","eFG%","FT%","ORBG","DRBG","TRBG","ASTG","STLG","BLKG","TOVG","PFG","PTSG")
  
# Create a correlation heatmap using players' statistics
colo <- colorRampPalette(c("#7F0000", "red", "#FF7F00", "yellow", "#7FFF7F", 
                           "cyan", "#007FFF", "blue", "#00007F"))

`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`[names(`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`) %in% varibls] %>% relocate('PTSG',.after = last_col()) %>% cor() %>% 
  corrplot(order = "hclust", addrect = 2, col = colo(10)) 
```

3. Difference between groups

The boxplot shows that centers have higher `Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%)` than other players, so our estimation is that more funding should be apportioned to centers.
```{r position}
# Boxplot
`2018-19_nba_player-statistics` %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Pos,`eFG%`, FUN = median),y=`eFG%`))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(col=Pos))+
  geom_jitter(width=0.3,alpha=0.1,aes(col=Pos))+
  xlab("Position") +
  ylab("Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%)") +
  ggtitle("Field Goal Percentage by Position")+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "right")
```

### d) Justification for decisions made about data modelling.

To help teams find the most suitable players, we need to understand the relationship between the dependent variable `the percentage of wins (WinP)` and other explanatory variables. For example, when `Net Rating (NRtg)` increases by one per cent, to what extent will `the percentage of wins (WinP)` increase. After that, we build a second regression model based on players' statistics. However, there are only 30 samples in the `team_stat` dataset, which is quite small. Deziel(2018) argues that a small sample size will increase the margin of error and decrease the statistical power.[9] As a result, we will build a regression model using `Points per game (PTSG)` as the dependent variable. We don't use `salary` as the dependent variable because some players play at different positions in the 2018-19 season, and salaries differ significantly among positions. Still, we don't know how much have these players earned from each position. Wolf (2019) did a survey and found that centers have the highest average salaries, 46 per cent higher than that of power forwards.[10]

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Average Player's Salary by Position.png")
```

# 4. Data modelling and results

The second correlation heatmap shows that many factors positively impact `Points per game (PTSG)`. However, including too many features will lead to the problem of overfitting. Estevez (2018) suggests fitting a Random Forest model to identify variable importance.[11]

The variable importance plot shows that `Turnovers per game (TOVG)`, `Defensive rebounds per game (DRBG)`,  `Steals per game (STLG)`, `Total rebounds per game (TRBG)` and `Assists per game (ASTG)` are the five most important factors on `Points per game (PTSG)`. `Defensive rebounds per game (DRBG)` and `Total rebounds per game (TRBG)` are highly correlated, so `Total rebounds per game (TRBG)` will be discarded. `Assists per game (ASTG)` and `Turnovers per game (TOVG)` also show a strong positive relationship, so `Assists per game (ASTG)` will be discarded as well. Thus, the model has three explanatory variables, which are `Turnovers per game (TOVG)`, `Defensive rebounds per game (DRBG)` and `Steals per game (STLG)`.

```{r variable_importance, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install the package "caret" if not installed
if(!require(caret)){
  install.packages("caret")
}

# Load the package "caret"
library(caret)

# A dataset containing variables used for modelling
datst <- `2018-19_nba_player-statistics` %>% select(all_of(varibls))

colnames(datst) <- make.names(colnames(datst))

rPartMod <-  train(PTSG ~ ., data=datst, method="rpart")
rpartImp <-  varImp(rPartMod,10)
plot(rpartImp, 
     top = 6, 
     main="Variable Importance based on players' statistics")
```

### a) Data modelling (e.g. creating a linear regression).

A multiple linear regression model with three explanatory variables is built.

```{r data_modelling, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install the package "broom" if not installed
if(!require(broom)){
  install.packages("broom")
}

# Load the package "broom"
library(broom)

# A function to extract coefficients 
source("funcs/Equation.R")

# multiple linear regression model
model <- lm(PTSG ~ TOVG + DRBG + STLG, data = `2018-19_nba_player-statistics`)
```

The equation of the model:
```{r equation}
regEq(model,3)
```

### b) Assumption checking.

1. Response variable

The response variable `Points per game (PTSG)` is continuous.

2. Explanatory variables

All three variables, `Turnovers per game (TOVG)`, `Defensive rebounds per game (DRBG)` and `Steals per game (STLG)`, are continuous.

3. Independence of observations

We can tell from our study design that we do not have independence of observations as we are just analysing basketball players from one season, meaning there are no repeated measures.

Nonetheless, we can also test that our residuals are not autocorrelated with the DW test. Our results are 1.6, which is close to the recommended 2 to ensure independence. 

Thus we have not failed this assumption. 
```{r independence of obsevations, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install the package "car" if not installed
if(!require(car)){
  install.packages("car")
}

# Load the package "car"
library(car)

# DW test
durbinWatsonTest(model)
```

4. Linear relationship

Partial regression plots suggest that there is a linear relationship between the response variable `Points per game (PTSG)` and each explanatory variable.
```{r linear relationship}
# partial regression plots
avPlots(model)
```

5-1. Outliers

There are six outliers with a z-score higher than 3, so the assumption has not been met.
```{r outlier, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

std_res <- rstandard(model)
points <- 1:length(std_res)
labls <- if_else(std_res >= 3, paste(points), "")

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = points, y = std_res, label = labls)) +
  geom_point(color = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.1, cex =3)+
  ylim(c(-4,4)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(-3, 3), colour = "red", linetype = "dashed")+
  theme_classic()
```

5-2. Leverage points

No high leverage points have been found, so the assumption has been met.
```{r leverage points}
hats <- hatvalues(model)

hat_labels <- if_else(hats >= 0.10, paste(points), "")

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = points, y = hats)) +
  geom_point(color = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = hat_labels), nudge_y = 0.005)+
  theme_classic()
```

5-3. Influential points

Five influential points have been found, so the assumption has not been met.
```{r influence}

cook <- cooks.distance(model)

cook_labels <- if_else(cook >= 0.05, paste(points), "")

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = points, y = cook)) +
  geom_point(color = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = cook_labels), nudge_x = 1)+
  theme_classic()
```

6. Homoscedasticity

The assumption of homoscedasticity has not been met. The residual plot shows a triangle pattern, and the Breusch–Pagan test also suggests the issue of heteroscedasticity. Hence, a WLS model is needed.
```{r homoscedasticity, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
res <- residuals(model)
fitted <- predict(model)

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = fitted, y = res)) +
  geom_point(colour = "dodgerblue") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "red", linetype = "dashed")+
  theme_classic()

# Install the package "lmtest" if not installed
if(!require(lmtest)){
  install.packages("lmtest")
}

# Load the package "lmtest"
library(lmtest)

bptest(model)
```

7. Residuals

The assumption of residuals following the normal distribution has not been fully met, which is one of the results of heteroscedasticity.
```{r residuals}
ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = res)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "black", fill = "dodgerblue", bins = 8)+
  theme_classic()

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(sample = res)) +
  stat_qq() + 
  stat_qq_line()+
  theme_classic()
```

8. Multicollinearity

The plot suggests that there is a positive relationship between variables, and further investigation is needed. VIF is lower than 5, so the issue of multicollinearity does not exist.
```{r multicollinearity}
# Plot
pairs(formula = ~ PTSG + TOVG + DRBG + STLG, data = datst)

# Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
vif(model)
```

### c) New model:

```{r second_model, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
outliers <- which(std_res >= 3)

high_influential_points <- which(cook >= 0.05)

removed_points <- unique(c(outliers,high_influential_points))

`2018-19_nba_player-statistics` <- `2018-19_nba_player-statistics`[-removed_points,]

`2018-19_nba_player-statistics` <- `2018-19_nba_player-statistics` %>% mutate(PTSGn = PTSG/(TOVG^0.5), 
TOVGn=TOVG/(TOVG^0.5), 
DRBGn=DRBG/(TOVG^0.5),
STLGn=STLG/(TOVG^0.5),
interceptn=1/(TOVG^0.5))

# Install the package "IDPmisc" if not installed
if(!require(IDPmisc)){
  install.packages("IDPmisc")
}

# Load the package "IDPmisc"
library(IDPmisc)

`2018-19_nba_player-statistics` <- NaRV.omit(`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`)

model_NEW <- lm(PTSGn ~ + 0 + TOVGn + DRBGn + STLGn, data = `2018-19_nba_player-statistics`)
```

Residual plot and the Breusch–Pagan test:

Both the residual plot and the bp test show that the issue of heteroscedasticity no longer exists.
```{r wls1}
plot(model_NEW,1)

bptest(model_NEW)

### d) Model output and interpretation of your model.

1. Interpretation:

Intercept: WLS model does not have an intercept

Slope estimate of `Turnovers per game (TOVGn)` = 4.28, meaning that for every 1 unit that `Turnovers per game (TOVGn)` is incresaed, a player's points per game increases by 4.28.

Slope estimate of `Defensive rebounds per game (DRBGn)` = 0.961, meaning that for every 1 unit that `Defensive rebounds per game (DRBGn)` is incresaed, a player's points per game increases by 0.961.

Slope estimate of `Steals per game (STLGn)` = 2.05, meaning that for every 1 unit that `Steals per game (STLGn)` is incresaed, a player's points per game increases by 2.05.

2. The summary of the model:

Based on the p-values and an alpha = 5%, we can conclude that slope estimates are statistically significant.
```{r model_summary_slope}
tidy(model_NEW)
```

3. $R^{2}$:

R-squared = 0.911, meaning that 91.3% of the variance in `Points per game (PTSGn)` is explained by the variances in explanatory variables.

4. F distribution:

The p-value of F distribution is 2.2e-16, which is less than 5 per cent, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that at least one slope is not equal 
to 0 (i.e., the regression is significant).
```{r model_summary_whole}
glance(model_NEW)
```

# 5. Player recommendations

NBA teams are allowed to carry 15 players on the active roster for regular seasons. We recommend that about half of the payroll budget be spent on the five starting players (i.e., salaries paid to five starting players are two times higher than those of the other ten players). Thus, the payroll budget for these five players is $56299100.5.

Since Center and Point Guard are the two most important positions, more funds have to be spent on these two players. Based on each position's average salary (Wolf,2019)[10], the rough allocation of funds is:

`Center`: $13511784.12 (24% of 56299100.5 dollars)

`Point guard`: $12948793.115 (23% of 56299100.5 dollars)

`Small forward`: $11259820.1 (20% of 56299100.5 dollars)

`Shooting guard`: $9570847.085 (17% of 56299100.5 dollars)

`Power forward`: $9007856.08 (16% of 56299100.5 dollars)

The next step is selecting players whose actual points per game are higher than predicted.
```{r player recommendation}
`2018-19_nba_player-statistics`$fit <- as.vector(fitted.values(model_NEW))

Recommendation <- `2018-19_nba_player-statistics`%>% filter(fit >=PTSGn) %>% left_join(subset(`2018-19_nba_player-salaries`,select = -player_id), by = "player_name")

# Center
Recommendation %>% filter(between(salary,0.9*13511784.12,1.1*13511784.12) & Pos == "C") %>% arrange(desc(TOVGn))

# Point guard
Recommendation %>% filter(between(salary,0.9*12948793.115,1.1*12948793.115) & Pos == "PG") %>% arrange(desc(TOVGn))

# Small forward
Recommendation %>% filter(between(salary,0.9*11259820.1,1.1*11259820.1) & Pos == "SF") %>% arrange(desc(TOVGn))

# Shooting guard 
Recommendation %>% filter(between(salary,0.85*9570847.085,1.15*9570847.085) & Pos == "SG") %>% arrange(desc(TOVGn))

# Power forward
Recommendation %>% filter(between(salary,0.9*9007856.08,1.1*9007856.08) & Pos == "PF") %>% arrange(desc(TOVGn))
```
If two or more players are suitable, a player having the highest `Turnovers Per game (TOVGn)` will be selected for the new season.

Center: Mason Plumlee

Point guard: Jeremy Lin

Small forward: Robert Covington

Shooting guard: Markelle Fultz

Power forward: Jared Dudley

# 6. Summary

In conclusion, A player's points per game depend on three factors, turnovers per game, defensive rebounds per game, and steals per game. The correlation heatmap using teams' statistics shows that the more point a team get in a game, the higher probability of winning the game.

The study does not build a model analysing the factors that make the team successful as the sample size is too small. More samples are needed in future studies. In addition, players' salaries usually consist of several parts and differ significantly among positions. To build a model analysing which factors contribute more to salaries, we need to collect more data on the components of players' salaries. Furthermore, home-court advantage is a significant factor influencing wins. In the future, it can be used as a dummy variable in the data modelling.

The study uses multiple linear regression to build a model. Compared with other machine learning algorithms, it is relatively simple and sensitive to outliers. Many factors drive a team or a player's success, but multiple linear regression cannot capture all these important features. In the future, the study will apply more advanced algorithms such as the Random Forest and XGBoost.
